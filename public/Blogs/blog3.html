          Dicele is a daily number game that offers a calm and challenging experience for players. Inspired by popular puzzle games like Sudoku and Wordle, Dicele helps to train your mind and test your IQ.            <br>
            <br>
            In Dicele, the daily puzzle feature is similar to games like Wordle, Waffle, Nerdle, and Quordle, but with an interesting analytical twist. Since the game is based on numbers, it can be played by people across all countries without any language barriers. It is also a short duration game, making it perfect for short breaks at school or work, while waiting in a queue, or during travel.

            <br>
            Dicele is the perfect way to relax and unwind. While word games test your vocabulary, Dicele sharpens your analytical and logical reasoning skills, making you smarter in life. All you need to do is identify patterns and predict the numbers in their correct places to add to the sum of rows and columns displayed on the board. This simple math puzzle can be enjoyed by smart kids and adults alike.            <br>
            <br>
            To play Dicele, the objective is to solve the puzzle in 21 moves. Players must swap the dice on the board to match the sum mentioned on the row and column. Once the correct position of the dice is predicted, it turns green. The goal is to complete matching all 21 dice in their correct positions. Finishing the level in 16 moves earns all 5 stars. Playing daily allows players to collect stars and new rewards.
