            <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
            Employees are in direct contact with customers when they work for companies that offer services to customers. Customer satisfaction is greatly affected by the way employees communicate their non-verbal and verbal communications. Their communication is divided into verbal or non-verbal in every transaction between a service provider, customer, and business associate.
            <br>
            <br>
            Paralanguage, proxemics, kinesics and paralanguage are all elements of non-verbal communication. These rudiments all contribute to how buyers judge a company. Customers feel appreciated when they are made eye contact with and smile (Gabbott & Hogg 2001).
            <br>
            <br>
            These also help to give customers the impression that the service provider is confident in the service they are offering. Customers may be skeptical about a paralanguage like tone variation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Certain proxemics can help customers change their attitude towards a company or its employees. A restaurant attendant who is comfortable touching customers can lead to positive attitudes. Customers will return to the restaurant if they are served by an attendant. In the event of any complaints, an attendant can convince customers.
            <br>
            <br>
            Other than proxemics and kinesics, the physical appearance of an employee can also impact customer satisfaction. Customers trust employees who are attractive and friendly. These are non-verbal signals that can increase buyer contentment.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Kinesics</b></h4>

            Kinesics is a term that refers to body movements. It is a common phenomenon in all communication. Kinesics can be described as eye contact, smiles, handshaking and orientation. Different kinesics communicate different messages depending on their context.
            <br>
            <br>
            Kinesics is a key component of improving customer satisfaction and meditation in business establishments, especially those offering services. If a staff member dealing with a customer maintains eye contact, it shows that they are honest with what he or she is saying (Jung and Yoon, 2010). This increases trust in the service provider.
            <br>
            <br>
            Customers feel valued and appreciated when their body movements are associated with courtesy. Research in the banking sector found that customers who maintain eye contact with employees builds strong relationships. Customers trust such employees because they are honest and trustworthy.
            <br>
            <br>
            A smile is generally considered one of the best non-verbal communication to show interpersonal warmth. A smile from a worker to their customers builds a positive relationship. Customers feel valued and are more likely to share their experiences with service providers. People who smile at their customers are said to be friendly and accommodating.
            <br>
            <br>
            Customers feel more confident in their ability to attend to them when they have any transactions. Customers feel that they are treated with kindness and respect when dealing with the company.
            <br>
            <br>
            Combining non-verbal cues can make the effect even more powerful (Tsai & Huang 2002). Customers feel more comfortable when employees smile and make eye contact with them.
            <br>
            <br>
            A smile is the first sign that a customer is being treated well. This customer is more likely to return to the business and feel respected.
            <br>
            <br>
            In certain situations, nodding can significantly increase customer satisfaction. This is particularly true for businesses that offer professional services, such as legal institutions. These services require intensive interpersonal communication and consultations (Jung & Yoon 2010, 2010).
            <br>
            <br>
            The parties involved should show empathy, consideration, and understanding. Nodding and keeping eye contact with the customer show that the lawyer is not only able to understand the situation but also is compassionate (Gabbott & Hogg 2001). This encourages the customer to cooperate and give all information.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Paralanguage</b></h4>

            Paralanguage is a non-verbal communication technique that includes vocal tone, tone variation, amplitude and fluency. Paralanguage is used by employees in business to gauge their confidence in what they are saying.
            <br>
            <br>
            Paralanguage cues are used to communicate with patrons in restaurants. Customers will perceive the restaurant as more customer-oriented than work-oriented if this is done (Jung & Yoon 2010, 2010).
            <br>
            <br>
            Paralanguage should be used in public speaking mode in order to communicate with customers when staff are working for a business that is task-oriented. This will help one show proficiency and vigor in the field. Customers will eventually trust him or her and be more willing to get his or her help.
            <br>
            <br>
            Customers may be reluctant to have a conversation with you at times. To encourage customers to engage in conversation, service providers may use louder and faster tonal tones. These non-verbal cues can be used to persuade customers that verbal cues will not work (Gabbott & Hogg 2001).

            <h4><b>Proxemics</b></h4>

            This is the relative distance employees maintain when they are attending to customers. Touch is one of the most important proxemics elements, especially in the service industry. Employees can use touch to draw customers' attention and make them active participants in transactions, which will affect their perception of the company.
            <br>
            <br>
            Customers who are touched by employees are more likely to listen to what they're being told. When a beauty therapist touches customers, it is found that they have positive attitudes about the business of the therapist (Sundaram & Webster 2000).
            <br>
            <br>
            Customers who have had contact with wait staff tend to be more open to being served. These customers also show positive regard for restaurant attendants.
            <br>
            <br>
            Customers expect you to be friendly with them. This allows the customer to communicate effectively with the employee. The customer can then evaluate the company and see its true image. Customers will be more positive about the company if they are kept in check when dealing with them.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Physical appearance</b></h4>

            The non-verbal cues that tell a lot about an organization and its employees are physical appearance. This cue is often overlooked by informal organizations. Physical attractiveness is one of the key characteristics that can help buyers feel satisfied. Generally, customers trust employees who are attractive and physically fit (Jung & Yoon 2010).
            <br>
            <br>
            They can also influence their clients to make decisions that are in the company's favor. Physical attractiveness is a sign that customers will find you friendly and accommodating. Physically attractive people are more likely to be friendly, intelligent, and well-prepared than those who are less attractive.
            <br>
            <br>
            Customers have different perceptions of employees and organizations due to the diversity in their attire. People working in legal or banking institutions should wear suits and tie for men, and gray or black suits for women. Customers will see them as competent and credible in their field, and they will be more willing to work with them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Service providers' attires can influence customers' perceptions to a large extent (Tsai & Huang 2002). If employees are dressed in dark colors, they can be regarded as authoritative and superior. Staff who wear lighter clothes are considered more social.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Conclusion</b></h4>
            Organizations have long ignored the importance of non-verbal communication in customer satisfaction. Customers' perceptions of a company are influenced by non-verbal cues, such as kinesics. If a customer is greeted with a smile when they first visit a company, it will feel like the company cares about them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Customers also judge organizations based on the way they are dressed. Companies whose employees are well-dressed and wear suits are viewed as intelligent and competent.
            <br>
            <br>
            Customers feel comfortable with these companies because they are confident that they will receive quality services. Customers are convinced by paralanguages such as touch. Customers will have a positive view of the organization and its staff, which leads to them returning to the company for products or services.
