            <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>

            Peer tutoring has become a popular method for helping autistic children develop communication skills. Peer-tutoring is a peer tutoring method that uses peer mates to assist a learner with specific skills.
            <br>
            <br>            
            A child with autism can develop in the areas where he/she is lacking by playing games and having fun with peers. This study examined the positive effects of peer-tutoring to teach basic communication skills to autistic children.
            <br>
            <br>  
            <h4><b>Methodology</b></h4>
            
            The researcher will examine a group of ten students in second grade with autism disorders. This is to test the research question. In a peer-tutoring setting, a range of activities will be implemented to improve communication skills for children with autism. All efforts will be made in order to avoid compulsive initiations.
            <br>
            <br>  
            Therefore, it will be crucial to observe data but not interfere with normal interactions between students with autism and their peers. The tutors will not encourage interactions between children with autism and their normal peers, but they will try to limit them as much as possible.
            <br>
            <br>  
            The researcher is interested in observing the natural initiations of each student participating in the study, and how students with autism disorder react to initiations by their normal peers during play time. The study lasted five months and occasional observation was made during play time. Five of the ten autistic students who were selected for the study (four boys, one girl) received basic communication skills training from their peers. The rest did not.
            <br>
            <br>  
            <h4><b>Participants</b></h4>
            
            This study included a sample of ten autistic children. All participants were second-grade children who attended inclusive schools. Two of the children with autism were girls, while the rest were all boys.
            <br>
            <br>  
            The above-mentioned sample was all diagnosed with autism by a team of four psychiatrists who had observed their condition for three months prior to the study. Eight of the eight participants were autistic, while two others had Asperger’s syndrome. This study involved peer trainers who were classmates or age mates with the sample participants.
            <br>
            <br>  
            <h4><b>Measures</b></h4>
            
            The observer, a clinical psychologist, will benefit from being as close as possible to the interactions between learners to get accurate data. Teachers were trained to recognize groups of students with autism who will interact with each learner. They encouraged interaction between the learners.
            <br>
            <br>  
            The observer would measure two important parameters: the number and quality of play mates initiating children with autism, and the response rate from students with autism.
            <br>
            <br>  
            <h4><b>Procedure</b></h4>
            
            The study has ten participants, with five of them being used as a control sample. This means that five students did not participate in the experiment. A teacher will select four students to be allowed to interact with the autistic students during play time.
            <br>
            <br>  
            Normal learners will instruct their autistic counterparts how to greet each other by hand during these play-time interactions. They are also free to engage in all kinds of natural interactions. Interactive sessions include activities like playing with balls, greeting one another by hand, and playing with toys.
            <br>
            <br>  
            All the above-mentioned activities were conducted within the school's compound. A clinical psychologist was able to collect data during interactions that were not interrupted by ongoing activities.
            <br>
            <br>  
            After two months in which five autistic students had been actively trained by their classmates to improve their communication skills, the rest were exposed to the same environment of playing with their classmates during play time. The data was collected from both the study samples.
            <br>
            <br>  
            <h4><b>Data Analysis Plan</b></h4>
            
            This research aims to highlight the positive effects of tutoring students with autism to improve their communication skills. The researcher divided a group of ten students into two groups, each consisting of five students. The researcher was able to distinguish positive outcomes from peer-tutoring in the first group, while the other was not.
            <br>
            <br>  
            The researcher wants to know the rate at which students with autism have natural responses after being exposed to peer-tutoring. This was done by subtracting the number of responses from autism-disabled children from the number of initiations received from their peers during the observation sessions. Peer-tutoring was also a factor in the development of autism confidence (Autism).
            <br>
            <br>  
            <h4><b>Explanation</b></h4>
            
            Peer training produced a variety of positive outcomes, as it was observed. Peer-tutoring can improve the communication and social skills of autistic children by increasing their response rate compared to their peers. This observation was made in a variety of studies, including that by Harper Blauvelt.
            <br>
            <br>  
            Peer-tutoring was a key factor in the success of targeted children with autism. They were able learn to greet their peers and request things. This study confirms the fact that peer-tutoring can improve the communication and social skills of autistic second graders with autism disabilities.
            <br>
            <br>  
            <h4><b>Limitations</b></h4>
            
            It is evident that the sample used in the study was only ten to reach a more convincing conclusion. This was due to a lack of resources and time. The observer used assumptions to measure responses from children with autism in the above study. These assumptions were not accurate enough to accurately measure responses from the target population. A student might respond to an initiation in ways that are difficult to observe.
            <br>
            <br>  
            <h4><b>Significance and conclusion</b></h4>
            
            Peer-tutoring can be a useful tool in helping autistic second graders with autism develop communication skills, confidence, and socialization skills. As a way to help autistic learners develop their strengths, educational planners can adopt comprehensive peer-tutoring methods.
            <br>
            <br>  
            It is important to note the differences in improvement that were noted in the study. Future researches should focus on the individual aspects of learner such as the home environment, type of autism and history. This will help to design a peer-tutoring method for each student who is identified as having autism.
