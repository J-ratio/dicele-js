          <p> Modern business has seen a dramatic shift in the way it operates (Teece 2010, 2010). Customers today have more options because they can access alternatives to any product (Teece 2010,). Modern product retailing is fiercely competitive. The supermarket industry is one of its most important areas. Supermarket industry players must use successful business strategies to achieve success. Low pricing is a popular strategy to attract customers and promote sustainability within this industry. Based on literature review, it is possible to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of this business strategy and make recommendations for its future implementation in supermarkets.

        <div class="w3-container">
          <p> It is clear that international home and host strategy must be considered in light of the current global environment and global context. The changing world presents new challenges to business strategy planning and target (Cavusgil Ghauri Knight, Knight, & Riesenberger, 2014). Business analysts of all levels have been discussing the notion of international competitveness. Business performance analysis requires an explanation for why certain countries are more successful in particular fields than others. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the model that can reveal the reasons for the economic dominance of certain national industries. Michael Porter introduced one of the models that attempts to do this. His theory explains the high level of competitive competence in certain industries due to the favorable home environment. However, analysts have pointed out many drawbacks to such an approach due to its narrow contextual method (Astarlioglu 2012). It is unclear how much Porter's Diamond Model can explain home and host locations strategies in international business.
