            The 18th century saw the public recognize the importance of salesmanship and the modern form of advertising was born. Today, it is impossible to imagine a life without being openly sponsored by a range of media for public communication.
            <br>

            Advertising can convince people to purchase goods and services they are interested in. Consumers fall prey to advertising myths and end up in long lines for goods that they don't even understand the practical application.
            <br>
            <br>
            Advertisers are primarily interested in influencing consumer preferences. There are at least three ways to achieve this goal. Advertising may increase the perceived value of a product to the consumer. Advertising that encourages people to pay more is this type of advertising.
            <br>
            <br>
            The second is that advertising campaigns by firms can be viewed as a tug of war in which every firm tries to get consumers to buy its products. This is advertising that alters ideal product varieties.
            <br>
            <br>
            Advertising may also encourage consumers to place more emphasis on differences between products. Advertising that emphasizes product differences is this (Fehr and Stevin 56). In all three cases, people are convinced they can buy the product they want and adapt their buying habits to match market trends.
            <br>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, modern life means that consumers don't buy the things they need to live; instead, they purchase things simply to have them. James B. Twitchell, In Praise Of Consumerism (2006) argues that people don't buy goods; they only buy the hopes and dreams of sellers.
            <br>
            <br>
            The more hope the seller presents, the greater the chance of the seller gaining from that customer. This complicated interrelationship between customers and marketers leads to artificial values.
            <br>
            <br>
            The rise of advertising as an integral part of commercial culture has a profound effect on people's attitudes to the world. Advertisements not only push products but also certain lifestyle patterns. This is especially true for the young, who seem to be most susceptible to the messages of TV, radio and billboards.
            <br>
            <br>
            Advertising is believed to have the essence of the hegemony it creates by its influence on customers' moral principles, and life patterns. Advertising establishes not only one brand's hegemony but also the hegemony over patterns and ideas.
            <br>
            <br>
            This hegemony has the direct consequence that the consumer is confused about what they are buying. In one TV advertisement, a young couple drives down a street with their windshield wipers clanking.
            <br>
            <br>
            They're so tuned in that they can see the passing scene with its tempos. For example, a boy bounces a basketball in perfect sync to the beat of their windshield wipers. What's the deal? It is the Volkswagen model's advertising that suggests "your parents don't get this, but you do" (Wolkomir Rich and Wolkomir Joyce 662). The idea is what captures the attention of the audience, and then the product.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is difficult to assess the truth of information received when one is in a state of total belief in the idea being presented. This is a great opportunity for advertisers to profit from the unawareness of their audience and use it for their marketing purposes. They appear to be suggesting: Buy this, and don't care if it is as good or not.
            <br>

            Rosser Reeves made a TV commercial in 1950s that featured a hammer clacking an anvil. This was to remind viewers of the pain of a headache (or to induce one), while also reporting good news about Anacin.
            <br>
            <br>
            He said that advertising was responsible for convincing you that the quarters were different. The ad needed to convince you that one quarter was more valuable (Wolkomir Rich and Wolkomir Joy 660). A terrible headache can make it difficult to think about the best medicine for you. The only way out is to believe the advertisement and buy the recommended medication.
            <br>
            <br>
            We fail to warn ourselves about the dangers of allowing advertisements to clutter our lives. We become an exact mirror of what we buy, and we don't make rational decisions about which products we purchase.
            <br>
            <br>
            Representatives from the Frankfurt School claimed that the modern world is technocratic, and that it exists at the cost of spreading false information through mass media and pop music that play a crucial role in the growth and acceptance of the consumption cult.
            <br>
            <br>
            This idea is relevant to advertising. This idea is very relevant to the problem of advertising. Only in this way, the customer's situation will improve.
