            Social networking is a virtual community where people form groups to share a common goal. Social networking was traditionally done offline with friends or others who share a common interest. However, technological advances have made it possible to socialize online            <br>
            <br>
            There are many people who want to interact on social network sites such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook and Twitter. Social network platforms allow for discussions and disputes on a variety of topics and ideas.
            <br>
            <br>
            These conversations cover everything from gardening and employment to cooking and making new friends. 2). The people in the same network often share many hobbies.
            <br>
            <br>
            Registered members of a social network can interact with each other and view their profiles. A social network exists solely to offer people an alternative method of communication. Social networking has revolutionized not only how people communicate, but also the ways that people structure their social interactions.
            <br>
            <br>
            As a social network tool, Facebook and other Internet sites have created a serious threat to traditional interaction. The future generation might not be able to understand the importance of physical interaction. It is clear that traditional interactions will soon be lost if online social networks have an impact.
            <br>
            <br>
            Baoku 9 points out that social networking can have many drawbacks. These disadvantages include cyberbullying, seclusion, a lack of expression options, and a diminished sense of dignity. Facebook and other social media sites were created to provide a greater avenue for communication (Baoku 9,).
            <br>
            <br>
            Over 75% of users of social media are teens (Boyd & Ellison 224). If they are not controlled and guided, their interactions can become very dangerous. Teenagers use social media to draw attention to their peers and not to the maturity of reasoning displayed by adults. Teenagers tend to post explicit photos to attract attention.
            <br>
            <br>
            The comments left on the "wall", tend to be very brief. Teenagers use controversial images to incite outrage among their peers and possibly spark a "flame", a heated discussion.
            <br>
            <br>
            According to a Harvard University study, many teenagers (both girls and boys) try to be more popular by portraying themselves as more outgoing, lighter-minded, and more vulgar than they actually are. They post photos of them smoking, drinking or dancing. This is a degrading act that lowers one's dignity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Due to the fact that teens are the majority of users of social networks, criminals have made them easy targets. Teenagers also expose themselves to bullying online. The worst form of bullying is online trolling on social media. Bullying can be devastating in real life, but it is much more bearable online.
            <br>
            <br>
            Cyberbullying is dangerous because everyone can see what is said about an individual ("The 2014 Survey: The Greatest Internet Impacts by 2025") para. 1). It is worse that a target individual cannot turn to anyone for help. Bullies are free to hurl insults at anyone they want, without the need for adult supervision or authority. Cyberbullying is not only destructive, but it can also be viral.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is an immoral and shameful act that should be avoided. Social networking restrictions can make it difficult for people to communicate safely on the internet.
            <br>
            <br>
            Regular use of social networking sites directly affects the amount of physical interaction between people. Because social networking is more effective than live communication, people stop using it. Social networking can lead to isolation. Social interaction is not necessary in modern times.
            <br>
            <br>
            The internet and computers allow for conversation. Social networking makes it easy to replace live conversations and language skills.
            <br>
            <br>
            Social networking has made it difficult to have a meaningful conversation. Because social networking doesn't allow people to use body language as part of the communication process, and the emphasis is on verbal communication, debating or confrontations are filled with obstacles. The chances of misunderstandings rising.
            <br>
            <br>
            Keep in mind, however, that social networks can cause serious communication problems in users, in addition to the inability of debate. Because one can live in a virtual reality, the social network can cause one to become detached from reality.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is easier to project an ideal image of yourself in virtual reality, where one's personality is hidden and the responsibility for one's actions and statements is significantly lower. The other problem with social networks is the rise in number of people you can contact; communication becomes less important.
            <br>
            <br>
            Inability to understand each other's body language will make it more difficult to have regular debates and arguments exchange. The foundation of humankind is socialization and regular interactions. Therefore, social websites may be a danger to humanity.
