            <h4><b>Executive Summary</b></h4>
            This report examines the vast differences between Japan and the United States and attempts to explain how Americans might encounter the difficulties of setting up a business in Japan. This report will help readers to understand the peculiarity of Japanese culture and the practices that must be followed to integrate into it.

            <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
            <h5><b>Scope</b></h5>
            This paper aims to introduce readers Japan, a country rich in cultural traditions that has greatly influenced its business culture. It is important to understand the Japanese business culture and the customs that they use to conduct business. This is because the Japanese value traditional business practices, even in relation to partnership and company operations.

            <br>
            Japan is currently the third-largest economy in the world. However, doing business within Japan is difficult. First, there is the problem of the local language. Although English is an essential subject in Japanese high schools, very few Japanese know it or are fluent in it. Foreign managers are often faced with difficult decisions. They must either use a translator all the time (which can be expensive), learn the language (which can take a significant amount of time) or limit their ability to hire the best talent.

            The second problem is the general hesitance that Japanese have towards foreigners. This is because almost all foreigners are labeled "gaijin", or "outsider" in order to denote someone who is not at their level or is not welcomed. Although there are many other complications, Japan is full of intelligent, hardworking individuals.

            <h5><b>How to get there</b></h5>
            It is easy to get to Japan. Most major U.S. airlines, such as American Airlines and UAL, have direct flights to Osaka or Tokyo. JAL (Japan Airline), Japan's national carrier, also offers direct flights to Japan. American citizens are usually allowed to enter the country without any difficulties. All you need is your passport to get in. For extended stays or employment in Japan, it is sometimes necessary to have a Japanese citizen sponsor you. To avoid any future problems, this can be done before you leave.

            <br>
            Enrolling in a Japanese language school is one way that many people use to start businesses or find work. Enrolling in one will immediately give you a student visa, which allows you to stay for several months without the need to obtain a sponsor. This allows U.S. citizens to stay for longer periods of time, while they work or start businesses in the country. To prevent renters simply using an apartment in Japan for a month without being guaranted, it is common to need a "guarantor". This is because first-time visitors to Japan are unlikely to meet a local who would be willing to act as their guarantor.

            <h5><b>Adjusting to the New Culture</b></h5>
            Before you venture into the Japanese corporate world, there are several things you should know. The first is the devotion shown by the Japanese to their work and their companies. Many Japanese employees work overtime and often stay with the same company until retirement. It is important to understand that overtime stays are based on cultural respect for seniority. Subordinates often feel "shameful" when they go home before their superior. According to Bartels 1982, if a manager does not return home, the subordinates do not go home either.
            <br>
            <br>
            This behavior is further supported by the Japanese business culture's sense of camaraderie and teamwork (Stone 2006). These aspects are usually praised in a company. However, the Japanese believe it is crucial for all members of their team to return home at the same moment. Bartels, 1982. If a member of the team is not done with their duties, they will stay behind to provide "moral support" and sometimes do nothing. The Japanese are well-known for their excessive overtime, which isn't necessarily productive. This is because the time spent in the office does not equal the work done. A second interesting aspect of the Japanese business culture that is worth mentioning is its emphasis on seniority. It is common for capability to be less valued than experience and age in a company (Stone 2006).

            This means that even if a junior has a brilliant idea or is able to do a task better than their senior, they must respect those who have been with them for a longer time. This has led to a lot of corporate stagnation in Japan. Seniors aren't used to new operating methods and so they are allowed to continue using old practices. This kind of business culture is the exact opposite of America's performance-oriented culture. It doesn't matter how old or experienced an individual is, as long as they are able to get the job done.

            <h4><b>Pragmatism in Hiring</b></h4>
            Japan's hiring practices are very different from the U.S. because they place more emphasis on education, experience, and conforming to company policies. It is important to note, first and foremost that Japanese residents have to meet higher education standards to be eligible for employment. To illustrate, even the most highly-regarded American or Filipino nurses cannot be employed as Japanese nurses unless they have graduated from a Japanese institution. (Getting to know You...Personal connections prevent problems in Japanese-Western alliances 2012). This is understandable given the need to ensure that hospitals have adequately trained personnel. However, it's also true that such behavior can be applied to other areas of employment.

            <br>
            Foreigners who are not part of an expanding Japanese company are often forced to integrate themselves into the entertainment or education sector. If you're looking to join a Japanese company, or to create hiring procedures for one, it is important to remember that Japanese employers prefer those who have received their education in Japan. It is recommended that you as a trainer manager try to hire employees while you are in the U.S. in order to avoid problems in Japanese-Western alliances. After you have established the employee infrastructure, you can start looking for local employees.
            <br>
            <br>
            Referring to the question of experience and conformity, Japanese companies tend to hire people who are seen as having the right amount of experience. They are more likely to be loyal to the company and to have the same business culture. They will be there for a long time. This is a disadvantage for foreigners looking to set up shop in Japan or work for Japanese companies. They would not have the experience necessary and would find it difficult to fully conform to Japanese business culture (Ralstone, 1995). Your loyalty to the company as a foreigner would be under scrutiny, and your chances of being trusted are diminished. The examples above show that Japan's hiring practices are not favorable to foreigners seeking employment or starting businesses.

            <h4><b>Pre-employment Testing</b></h4>
            Noticing that Japanese companies require that their employees speak Japanese is crucial. Potential foreign employees must be able communicate in Japanese to be able work in their respective workplaces. This is because if the company wants to expand in Japan, it will need to be able hire local talent to better understand the culture. It would be difficult for foreign workers to communicate with local workers, which could lead to a decrease in operational efficiency. Other than this, there are often a lot of qualifications and testing in specialized fields like nursing. However, to be a general employee within a company as "salary men", there is no additional testing except for Japanese fluency.

            <h4><b>Interviewing</b></h4>
            The interview process is similar to that in the U.S. However, for foreigners living in Japan, it is common to have Japanese language proficiency and this is often tested. This practice is necessary to help the company transition into local culture when hiring foreigners.

            <h4><b>Postings for Job Openings</b></h4>
            Gaijinpot.com Japanpost.com and tofugu.com are the best places to advertise for foreigners seeking a job in Japan. These sites can be accessed in English, but they are also used by Japanese citizens who want to see foreign perspectives on Japan. The Asahi Shinbun newspaper and the Japanese Post are two other popular options for advertising. It is best to hire Japanese-speaking foreigners first before hiring local employees. This is because foreigners can help the company develop the business culture, traditions, and mannerisms that Japanese employees have grown to expect without having to immediately hire locals.            <br>

            <h4><b>Cultural Differences</b></h4>
            Although differences in culture were discussed in the section about adapting to Japanese culture, it's important to remember that there are cultural nuances to consider before you enter the country. The Japanese culture emphasizes respect. This includes acts such as bowing when greeting someone for the first time and not looking directly at them when speaking. Honorifics are also used when addressing different types of people (Goddard 2007). This cultural difference is particularly important and should be respected. Using the first or last names of someone without using an honorific, even if they aren't close, can be considered rude.
            <br>
            <br>
            Honorifics can include "-san", plus the last names, which are meant to show respect for colleagues or business partners, "-kun", (male), and "-chan", (female). These honorifics are used often among friends or people who know each other well (Goddard 2007). Finally, honorifics should not be used and it is important to state a person's last name. This is reserved for close friends, family, and people in a relationship. It is crucial to keep in mind these distinctions and use honorifics correctly, as they are one of the foundations of Japanese society.

            <h4><b>Pragmatism in Recruitment</b></h4>
            Japan and the U.S. share many similarities in their hiring practices. They often consider which school the person is from before they hire them into the company. Japan goes further than the United States. People from well-respected universities like Tokyo University, Keo and University of Japan are often considered top candidates for the most prestigious companies. Resumes from people from lesser educational institutions should be avoided. Universities and companies have often reached an agreement that allows employees from certain universities to be offered top-tier positions as soon as they graduate (Ralstone, 1995). This agreement states that if a company needs excellent employees, it is worth checking out local universities to see if there are any agreements to be reached in order to find the best candidates.

            This paper shows that it is difficult to enter the Japanese market due to differences in business and social cultures. However, these differences can be overcome and great rewards can be achieved. Therefore, it is important to pursue entry into Japan's market.            <br>
