            The Internet has changed the way communication happens at work over the last decade. Emails are one of the most innovative communication methods that has emerged. Isabelle (2009) states that electronic mail is the most effective channel for communication around the world.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is therefore crucial that professionals are able to use technology effectively to communicate professionally at work.

            To ensure that the message is clear and understandable by recipients, it is important to have a set of standardized elements. Here are some things to keep in mind when sending an email to colleagues at work.
            <br>
            <br>
            First, it is important to ensure that the subject line of the message is engaging and grabs the recipient's attention. Many people delete messages without even reading the subject line.            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            It is therefore important for the title to be clear and concise. The message must be clear and concise, contain simple vocabulary and language, and should be well-punctuated.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important to ensure that emails are personal and connect with recipients. It is important to ensure that the email addresses are personal and connect with the recipient.
            <br>
            <br>
            Flynn N and Flynn T (2003) recommend that emailing should be limited to one subject. As a sender, you must not mix unrelated questions or responses in one email. Every email must address the subject you intended. You should also make sure to include a short summary when you forward a message to a colleague. This will allow the recipient to understand what the message is all about.
            <br>
            <br>
            Formatting an email can make the difference between an efficient and inefficient communication. Effective emails are concise and include the key points in the first line. It is important to specify who should reply and when.
            <br>
            <br>
            Remember to include signatures and greetings in all email correspondence. They reflect politeness and good manners. Effective communication requires that you use the correct tone, and avoid using pronouns and abbreviations.
            <br>

            <h4><b>Information authenticity: Clues</b></h4>
            Internet is often compared to an ocean of information. Some of the information on the Internet is valuable and useful, but there are also volumes of ineffective information. Patterson (2000) states that one of the problems with the Internet information is the absence of standards. As such, authenticity can sometimes be difficult to prove.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are clues that can help you establish authenticity. In most cases authentic data includes information about the author and proper citations to the original source of the published material. The information is balanced, without bias, contains dates, and is easy to find from any source.
            <br>
            <br>
            Sometimes, the authenticity of information can sometimes be inferred by the website where it was obtained. To provide accurate information about criminals, you can rely on reputable websites like www.fbi.gov. You can also check the URLs of many websites to verify the authenticity of information.
            <br>
            <br>
            Kennedy (2001) states that websites must end with a three letter suffix to indicate the domain of their host. Hence, it is possible to verify authenticity by going to such websites.
