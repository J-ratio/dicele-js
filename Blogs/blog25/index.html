            <h5><b>Introduction</b></h5>
            Banner Health is one the most well-known and productive companies in America's health care system. The non-profit organization was founded in Phoenix, Arizona in 1999. It has since spread its services throughout the United States. Banner Health manages 28 hospitals and other medical facilities. The company is a leader in the operation of medical facilities, including pharmacies, hospitals and laboratories. It also provides health care services for people who need them. They also take care of those with disabilities that cannot leave their homes and provide rehabilitation services. This organization is one of America's largest employers, employing approximately fifty thousand people in different states and regions. This paper will discuss Banner Health's ability to deal with possible health care issues in the coming decade, its business strategies, policies, and any other services it provides for patients.

            <br>
            <h5><b>The Next Decade's Health Care Needs</b></h5>
            It is well-known that every American company involved in the American healthcare industry is expected to establish priorities and develop plans that will positively impact the country's health and the environment. Banner Health's professional and serious approach to cancer is well-known. In fact, it established a partnership ("About Banner Health Network") with MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2017. It will therefore invest its financial resources and other instrumental resources to expand its cancer treatment facilities. Today, oncologic diseases affect a large number of Americans.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is also expected that these cases will become more common in the coming decade. However, communications and intensive education courses allow workers to gain knowledge and experience in the field of cancer treatment. (About Banner Health network, 2017). Banner Health is also developing future equipment to help people who have been exposed to radiation and are now suffering from health biases due to toxic evaporations. (Jakub 2015). The equipment mentioned above requires significant investment and time to develop, test, and register. The American government is able to provide the money necessary for these projects to be productive and efficient.
            <br>
            <br>
            Banner Health is still one of the top employers in the USA territory, as it was already mentioned. It is the top-ranked employer in Arizona ("About Banner Health network" 2017). The organization plans to invest around one billion dollars in renovating and modernizing its hospitals in Phoenix, Tucson, and other areas in order to maintain and grow its leadership positions. This business strategy will be implemented within the next 10 years to address various health care requirements of the citizens.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>Strategic Plans</b></h5>
            It is important to create and implement a plan to provide more services and grow any business. This plan should include strategies to increase the number of employees and improve the quality of resource management. Banner Health, as mentioned, is currently investing in financial resources to build and renovate its facilities. However, the strategy is more comprehensive and has specific goals that will also have an impact on the American healthcare system and the labor market.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before listing the strategies of Banner Health, it would be a good idea to briefly explain the main objectives. The company's goal is to improve cancer treatment and services. However, the company also plans to teach young professionals who are passionate about helping others ("About Banner Health network", 2017, 2017). This goal will see an increase in the number of top-quality employees from different states that will fill a multitude of new positions with their presence and labor (Drummond 2015). Banner Health is working to make this goal a reality by forming partnerships with some of the most prestigious universities in America (Drummond 2015). These partnerships will allow students to pursue more advanced educational programs and be employed after graduation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Banner Health's productivity is dependent on a highly-qualified resource management department due to the large amounts of financial and other resources flowing within the company (Drummond 2015). To address the above issue, the organization plans to train experienced staff to use new methods of accounting and to make better use of different resources. (Borkowski 2016, 2016). Some experts in informational technology are also working on the company’s website and electronic system's renovation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Last but not least, Banner Health's satisfaction with its patients and other medical facilities is a category that needs to be improved. The company offers one of the best services in the country and is highly regarded by citizens. However, there are still problems that need to be addressed to improve citizen relations and address concerns. This system is not profitable so its strategy is to lower the costs of medical supplies and treatment for patients. This issue has been a major problem in the USA for many decades. People with low incomes or those in vulnerable groups cannot afford to be admitted to a hospital for extended periods of time (Borkowski 2016, 2016). Banner Health is determined to implement the European health care strategy, and control the price of medicines in the country (Borkowski 2016). It's interesting to note that people from Third World countries are more likely than Americans to pay for their medical costs. Banner Health views this as an issue with the government.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is also appropriate to mention the existence of medical laboratories within the above-mentioned organization. These laboratories are currently developing new medicines to bring these products onto the pharmaceutical market. American citizens will be more confident in their ability to pay for various hospital expenses if their plan succeeds.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>Conclusion</b></h5>
            Banner Health was founded in 1999 and is a non-profit organization. Its primary goals are to improve the quality of healthcare services across the United States. It also invests in facilities that specialize in fighting cancer, which is a growing problem in our society. Banner Health has also expanded its hospitals and created professional education courses for future employees at colleges. This company still has a strategy plan. It is designed to address the American citizen's health care needs, to solve the nursing staffing problems, to improve resource management, and to improve patient satisfaction.
