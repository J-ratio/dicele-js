            <h4><b>Input</b></h4>
            The proposed system for medical order communication and the presentations on input technology revealed a viable approach to replacing an inefficient and archaic system. However, I think that there is room for improvement in what they are trying to achieve.
            <br>
            <br>
            Companies are increasingly integrating through online systems. Billing companies provide open access to payment centers and billing companies have the ability to connect to them. This system worked well for them and could be used in hospitals.
            <br>
            <br>           
            Faxing and document imaging technologies can be slow and inefficient compared to online forms. The iPad and other devices could be used to enter information directly into the system, which would greatly speed up the process.
            <br>
            <br>
            A more effective method to input information that would allow hospitals to be more efficient in their processes would be to use an online form integration system. Information from one computer station can immediately be transmitted to the other via internet using a pre-made form that contains the information required for the prescription.
            <br>
            <br>
            This system would not only provide faster input, but also solve any problems related to delays or possible errors in the order form.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although scanning images from a database can be very useful, it is susceptible to errors and may not be as easy as using online forms.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Images</b></h4>
            
            One thing I am critical of in medical imaging technology use is the lack of encouragement to develop open-source software applications for this technology.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are many applications, such as OsiriX for medical image viewing. However, FDA clearance is not yet available for clinical use.
            <br>
            <br>
            Open source platforms can be used to help drive innovation in certain technologies. This is something that must be understood. It was evident in the example of image compression in Morphometry Studies that there is not enough innovation beyond.
            <br>
            <br>
            TIFF and JPEG compressed images can be used to provide better image viewing for medical purposes. Open source applications are a great way to reduce the costs of medical image viewing.
            <br>
            <br>
            To allow this sector of the medical industry to grow, I advocate for more open-source programs.
            <br>

            <h4><b>Information Retrieval</b></h4>
            
            Habits are what make us human. This is a fact of human existence. People feel more at ease using tried-and-true methods that seem natural to them, such as walking, breathing, or eating.
            <br>
            <br>
            This subject can be reduced to an analysis inconvenience by stating that information retrieval methods like Google search and Google scholar are more popular than other forms of online information usage.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important to remember that even though something is convenient, it doesn't necessarily mean it's the best at what they do.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let's take for instance the comparison of Google Scholar and Pubmed searches. While both engines can access thousands upon thousands of articles on various medical topics, people tend to believe that Google Scholar is more efficient due to the sheer volume of content.
            <br>
            <br>
            This statement would be incorrect. A simple comparison of the search engines for DNA profiling using Cytochrome b or NADH 1 shows that PubMed has far more detailed and accurate articles.
            <br>
            <br>
            Information retrieval has a problem. People are often biased when using search engines. They use the same search engine over and again, despite the inefficiency of retrieving specific types of information.
            <br>
            <br>
            This could be explained by internet culture, where internet users adopt certain habits regarding internet use that become almost unbreakable over time.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Electronic Medical Records and Databases</b></h4>
            
            Based on the presentation of electronic medical records and databases, I believe there is a need for certain measures to record searches and evaluate them on different databases in order to assess the health status and individual needs.
            <br>
            <br>
            Electronic metadata can be used to record and evaluate information about specific medical conditions, as the reading of it suggests.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although this could lead to a lack of privacy for the nurses and doctors who use such systems, the fact is that an online database could be used to determine if there is an outbreak of a specific disease or illness in one area by evaluating the voracity with certain searches.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although hospitals keep records of each patient's case, it is not a given that hospitals can share information with one another, especially over a large area.
            <br>
            <br>
            A web-based program that specifically searches for patterns in user-submitted searches could be far more efficient and faster than traditional methods of determining if an outbreak is taking place in a hospital in a specific area.
