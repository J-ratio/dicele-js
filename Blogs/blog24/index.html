            Eastman Kodak faces severe competition. The company must come up with innovative solutions to help it regain its position as a leader in the sector. It is important to remember that the strategies Kodak uses are in line with the company's mission and vision. Eastman Kodak's vision is to improve safety, environment and health aspects of its products and services. The company is committed to protecting the safety of customers, employees, partners, communities, and the whole society. Corporate culture and responsibility are given special attention. Eastman Kodak's mission is to create and use innovative digital technologies while paying special attention to society and the environment. This will ensure that both the company's operations and the lives of its employees are sustainable. To bring this vision and mission to life, the company employs certain strategies. Analyzing strategies at the corporate, business, and functional levels is possible.
            <br>
            <br>
            Corporate level strategies therefore focus on issues such as sustainability, corporate culture and ethics (Carroll & Buchholtz 2014). These issues are essential to the company's future development. Eastman Kodak is focused on sustainability, innovation and inclusion ( Innovation 2014). Companies operating internationally need to pay attention to sustainability and social responsibility. Customers today are more likely to purchase from companies that are committed to the development of society than those that are focused on profit (Ketchen & Short 2011, 2011). Kodak's focus on innovation is crucial as it can help the company regain its position as a leader in this field. This strategy has proven to be successful in the past. It is notable that the company's efforts to be sustainable (both environmental and social) have been a boon for them. The company will build a stronger community, attract more customers, and have more reliable employees and partners.

            <br>
            These are the three key business-level strategies: product development, focused differentiation and market penetration. These strategies are closely linked to the corporate ones. The company can innovate and meet the customer's needs through focused differentiation (Ketchen & Short 2011, 2011). This company can add value and innovation to its products. Instead of just offering high-quality technology, the company can produce high-quality technologies that help create a better, more sustainable world. Digital offset plates can be provided that dramatically reduce the consumption of resources such as water, energy, and chemistry ( Innovation 2014). The company also contributes to reducing wastes by providing packaging solutions ( Innovation 2014).
            <br>
            <br>
            This strategy is closely linked to product development. Eastman Kodak must continue to innovate in order to be a successful company. This means that it needs to develop new products and services to meet the customers' needs. The company must also create the demand for certain products. It is crucial to get more people to support the company's efforts to create a sustainable society. Therefore, it is crucial that the company produces sustainable products.
            <br>
            <br>
            Functional level strategies encompass a broad range of activities, including marketing, finance and operations. Functional level strategies aim to achieve major company goals by minimizing costs and maximizing productivity. To understand how the company works towards its vision and mission, it is worth looking at the company's policies regarding human resources. Kodak's Employee Wellness and Health program is a significant contributor to creating a sustainable society. These benefits include a vocational program, a travel medicine program, care of children and the elderly, and flexible work schedules ( Employee safety and health, 2014). These benefits allow employees to live and work in a more pleasant environment. Another example of an effective strategy at the functional level. The inclusion program is a company initiative. It has an advisory board that makes sure that the principles of diversity are incorporated in every department's operations. Modern companies recognize the importance of public relations. Kodak's recent effort to offer low-cost office space within one of its office buildings contributes greatly to the development of the community ( Kodak space project 2014).

            <br>
            It is evident that Eastman Kodak uses strategies at the corporate, business, and functional levels that are closely linked to its mission and vision. The company's focus on innovation, inclusion, and sustainability gives Kodak high chances of regaining its industry leader status. Kodak introduces products and services that are a significant contribution to the development of communities and the whole society. The company employs innovative strategies to reach its goals.
