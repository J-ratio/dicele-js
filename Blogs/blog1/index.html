            Dicele is a daily number puzzle game that is both challenging and fun. The objective of the game is to solve the puzzle in 21 moves or less, by swapping the dice on the board to match the sum mentioned on the row and column. Once you predict the correct position of the dice, it will turn green, indicating that you have successfully matched the sum. The game is won by completing all 21 dice in their correct positions in 16 moves or less, earning all 5 stars.

            Playing Dicele is simple and easy to learn. To begin, you must first select a level to play. Each level presents a different puzzle, with various sums to be matched. Once you have selected a level, you can start swapping the dice to match the sums. To swap the dice, simply tap on the die that you want to move, and then tap on the position where you want to move it. The game will automatically calculate the sum of the row and column, and determine whether the move is valid or not. If the move is valid, the dice will be moved to the new position.
