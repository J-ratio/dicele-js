            <h4><b>The company's business goals and objectives</b></h4>
            
            A business's goals are a plan that will help it achieve its goals. These are the steps taken to reach these objectives. Clear goals and objectives are a guarantee that a business will achieve its goals and satisfy customers' needs. This business aims to provide affordable options for city workers to eat out. The food truck business is a great alternative for workers on a budget due to rising food costs (Gwo-Hshiung & Hung-Fan 2011, 2011).
            <br>
            <br>
            Clients will be provided with fresh, healthy food in a quick and efficient manner. This is a great option for clients who want to lower their cholesterol and those who don't have the time or desire to cook. The other objective is to meet potential clients. The food truck travels to busy places in the park and river piers on weekends and holidays, when most offices are closed.
            <br>
            <br>
            The manager must also explore areas of the city that are more lucrative (Jackson 2014). The business will experience a hectic schedule, which will result in steady income as it will be located in the most populated area of the city. The manager will create new menu items based on the needs of the clients. Clients will complete a questionnaire that will allow them to list the foods they want the truck supply. The manager will then be able to select the most popular meals from the questionnaires.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>What is success in management?</b></h4>

            Management defines success as achieving good returns on the business while maintaining high quality and affordable meals. The ability to offer food at lower prices will result in a significant rise in food demand and a rapid return on investment (Gwo-Hshiung & Hung-Fan 2011, 2011).
            <br>
            <br>
            This is why the business plays an important role in making sure that Portland employees eat healthy, nutritious food at lower prices. This lowers the risk of developing lifestyle diseases like diabetes. This will make it possible for people who work too hard to cook or go to restaurants. A positive brand image is essential to ensure success. It must have a consistent quality, regardless of fame. Happy clients will spread the word about the food product via word-of-mouth (Jackson 2014).
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>What are they trying achieve and why?</b></h4>

            Food trucks were created to meet people's hunger for food. This business targets workers who have limited time to prepare food and less time for lunch breaks. They are also unable to buy meals from restaurants due to high prices or other inconveniences.
            <br>
            <br>
            Fast food is not a good choice because it contains high levels of sugar and fats, which can raise cholesterol. Diabetes and overweight are caused by high cholesterol levels. People are now more informed about healthy and nutritious foods. Many people want high quality, freshly prepared meals at a lower price, which is why Jackson (2014) recommends it.
            <br>
            <br>
            All these requirements can be met by the food truck business. It is located in the heart of the city, and can cater to all clients' needs. The business will supply food for workers and then move to parks, where people may be eating picnics or needing a dessert. Accordingly, the business will be able to generate steady income both on weekdays as well as weekends (Gwo-Hshiung & Hung-Fan 2011, 2011).
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>What are the management roles and how will they be performed?</b></h4>

            This business structure is single proprietorship. This means that only one person is responsible for the management and ownership of the business. All management functions will be performed by the owner, who will also employ workers as needed. One person can run the business efficiently, as it only has one food truck. The owner is the key decision-maker, and the other worker assists in the preparation of meals at the food truck.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>What are the key skills required of managers?</b></h4>

            Managers work with clients to resolve disputes and motivate employees. They need to be able to communicate well with others (Jackson 2014). They will also be able to understand their clients' needs and will be able detect and resolve any conflicts with employees.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important to have business skills when balancing accounts or preparing payrolls for employees. If the company is earning good returns, the owner will be able to tell. These skills are also essential for a manager to be able pay taxes and bills on time. Managers with business skills can position the business in the most populated area of the city, where there is high demand for nutritious and healthy food (Gwo-Hshiung & Hung-Fan 2011, 2011).
            <br>
            <br>
            Managers running food trucks need to be able to manage their time. The meals must be prepared during the lunch break if the target market includes office workers. Managers must ensure that the food is prepared on time and delivered to all customers in the lunch break.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>What is the organization of the company? (e.g. organizational structure)</b></h4>

            The organization structure is how functions, such as management and sharing of responsibilities, are directed to achieve the business's goals and objectives. The organization structure is very simple because the business is owned by one proprietor and includes a single food truck. Gwo-Hshiung & Hung-Fan (2011) state that the main decision maker of the business is the owner. Communication is done one-on-one. Other workers include the chefs. The business structure may change depending on how it grows.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>The program's impact on the environment and its positive effects on community or social life.</b></h4>

            The local community benefits from the food truck business. It provides fresh, healthy meals to its customers. The truck is a great source of healthy and delicious meals for those who are concerned about their weight and health. Because they are less likely to be afflicted by weight-related diseases, this improves their social life. Because the truck is mobile, it can move into parks with lots of people and provide light meals and desserts. Their social needs will be met, and their lives will improve (Jackson 2014).
            <br>
            <br>
            A food truck can create a lot of litter around its operations. Because most customers eat their food and then throw the containers on to the ground, this is a problem. The business introduced eco-friendly containers to prevent litter (Jackson 2014). The city also offers a litter cleanup service, which ensures that all litter is removed and maintains a clean environment.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>You have created policies for human resources in your business</b></h4>

            <h5><b>Recruitment</b></h5>

            The ability to attract, retain, and develop workers that can ensure the business's continued growth is key to its success. It is important to hire workers who have professional skills that will help them establish a long-lasting relationship with the company. Worker should be open to learning and willing to adhere to the company's culture (Gwo-Hshiung & Hung-Fan 2011, 2011).
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>Employment</b></h5>

            All laws that affect employee rights will be supported by the Company. Management will follow the necessary procedures to ensure that these laws are enforced (Jackson 2014). Any employee who does not adhere to the business principles will be asked for their resignation. All employees must have a good working relationship with each other and not be subject to discrimination or harassment.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>Remuneration</b></h5>

            Based on employees' work performance, the food truck business will offer attractive remuneration. Salary and allowances will be part of the remuneration package. Management will need to research other similar businesses and obtain more information about remuneration packages (Gwo-Hshiung & Hung-Fan 2011, 2011).
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>Employee development program</b></h5>

            Employees are encouraged to improve their skills in order to be competitive in a dynamic market. All employees should be open to learning and willing to improve their skills. When training opportunities arise, the business will assist employees (Jackson 2014). Salespeople are encouraged to improve their skills, while chefs need to stay current on the latest trends in the food business.
