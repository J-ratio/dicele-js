            Communication is a key prerequisite for business success. It is important because it not only helps to relay important messages from top organizations but can also help solve organizational problems that may arise due to ineffective communication between customers and management.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is why organizations need to use the right strategies to ensure that customers get both good-news and bad news messages.
            <br>
            <br>     
            Because of the different interpretations of messages from different customers, it is one of the most difficult tasks in business. It is therefore essential to use the right communication strategies to ensure that the message achieves its intended goals.
            <br>
            <br>
            The starting paragraph should "cushion" any negative message. It should address the main issues of the message and provide an easy way to get to the main message without confusing the customer. The sender must ensure that the opening remark does not give away the message's nature, and to refrain from giving false encouragements.
            <br>
            <br>
            The introductory remarks should be followed by the justification. It is crucial to show the reader how they will benefit from the decline. The sender can then convey the message after the justification. To avoid anger, the sender should use indirect communication with positive words.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is crucial that the message has counter proposals. This will encourage the customer to avoid negative feelings and ensure the message achieves its intended goals. It is important to create a closing clause that encourages positive emotions in customers, so that they know that the company cares about them. You can encourage customers with counterproposals and resale possibilities.
            <br>
            <br>
            To avoid misinterpretation, senders should create a mechanism to cover any negative news in the introduction. Next, the sender should provide a brief explanation of why this refusal was made. It is crucial to use positive language when justifying the refusal. This can be done by suggesting a counterproposal, or a resale.
            <br>
            <br>
            This will help to change customers' negative emotions that may arise from bad messages. It is also important to encourage the receivers with positive messages.
            <br>
            <br>
            No matter what approach you choose, it is crucial to make sure that messages have the persuading power the sender expects. It is possible by arranging ideas in a clear and logical way. This requires proper planning. It should clearly show what message is carrying and give clues about the ideas, products and messages.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important to get to know the recipient's personality and likes and needs in order for it be persuasive. The outlines must be coherent and should unify concepts.
            <br>
            <br>
            Not only should the outline be convincing, message senders must ensure that their messages reflect ethicalness and responsibility. Communication must be honest and truthful. It is crucial that senders do not overstate messages. Instead, they should provide clear guidance as to what the message means.
            <br>
            <br>
            Logicality is an important aspect of maintaining ethical standards. It will allow receivers to correctly decode and encode messages. Senders must also ensure objectivity and accurate documentation to aid readers in discerning between facts and views.
            <br>
            <br>
            To sum it all, to make sure that the message conveys its full content and is logical, individuals should revise the messages before they are sent using the steps below. Analyzing the relationship between the original goals and the messages drafted is the first step.
            <br>
            <br>
            Revision should be done if the writer finds errors. This will ensure that the outline conveys the message. The third step is the rewriting. This process ensures that the message remains focused and contains all necessary facts. Therefore, smooth syntax is essential. After making all adjustments, the writers need to reread the information to verify that it is coherent and logical.
