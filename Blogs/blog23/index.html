            It is clear that international home and host strategy must be considered in light of the current global environment and global context. The changing world presents new challenges to business strategy planning and target (Cavusgil Ghauri Knight, Knight, & Riesenberger, 2014). Business analysts of all levels have been discussing the notion of international competitveness. Business performance analysis requires an explanation for why certain countries are more successful in particular fields than others. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the model that can reveal the reasons for the economic dominance of certain national industries. Michael Porter introduced one of the models that attempts to do this. His theory explains the high level of competitive competence in certain industries due to the favorable home environment. However, analysts have pointed out many drawbacks to such an approach due to its narrow contextual method (Astarlioglu 2012). It is unclear how much Porter's Diamond Model can explain home and host locations strategies in international business.

            Porter's Diamond Model was originally developed to aid in company performance analysis and for strategic planning. Michael Porter attempted to explain a specific phenomenon when he created the core postulates for the concept. Porter attempted to identify the reasons for a country's high level of competitiveness in a particular industry. Porter wanted to know why certain countries were more successful at producing electronics or cars. He also wanted to determine the reasons for cases where one country is a home to several world leaders. The main concern of Porter was international competitive dominance ( Porters Diamond Modell 2012). Porter suggests that we examine the problem according to the four main factors that are the corners of the diamond. This will help us determine the model's name. These factors include "factor conditions", "demand conditions", firm strategy, structure, and competition, and "the presence and support industries." (Bakan & Dogan 2012 p. 442). Further, the Porter's Diamond Model states that certain countries have initially more favorable conditions for the development and growth of certain industries.

            A favorable environment could be defined as having abundant natural resources, enough economic support, qualified staff, well-developed infrastructure, or unique production methods. Porter notes that countries without certain conditions are more likely than others to adopt innovative approaches to overcome their disadvantages. Michael Porter emphasizes the importance of demand conditions among all the factors that determine a company's success. He explained that an industry can't be a global competitor if there isn't enough demand in its home country for the services they offer ( Porter’s Diamond Model - Determining factors of National Advantage, n.d).

            It is important to note that this theory is both vigorously supported and severely criticized. Porter's Diamond Model's critics argue that it was based on an examination of developed countries like the USA, Japan and Germany. It is therefore doubtful that the same model could be used to explain the experiences of developing economies (Recklies, 2001). The model proposed is not able to explain the unique nature of manufacturing and banking activity. Therefore, it cannot be used to explain the phenomenon that companies have provisional service characteristics (Markus, n.d.). Porter's focus on the dominant determinant power and home environment tends to ignore the potential influence of external factors on company performance. Business analysts are often critical of Porter's underestimation external factors. The main drawback of the above-mentioned approach is the complete disregard for corporate management policies. Michael Porter doesn't believe that a well-executed strategy can help a company achieve prominent results, even when the conditions aren't as favorable as one might expect.

            Despite the fact that Porter's Diamond Model has a few drawbacks, such as its focus on developed countries and manufacturing specificity, there have been many attempts to adapt this model to different fields. Davis Neven (n.d.), and Cornelia Droge (n.d.), tried to use Porter's method to analyze agro-food clusters in the context of developing countries. Along with the Collective Efficiency Model, and the Flexible Specialization concept, Porter's Diamond Model were used. Researchers point out that Porter's model was highly effective in explaining the nature and dynamics of productivity within the companies. The model is also regarded as the best tool to detect existing frictions, compared with other models. Neven and Droge conclude that Porter's Diamond Model can be used to explain the phenomenon of developing countries, at least in the area of agrofood clusters. This model has many advantages, including a process-oriented approach that is lacking in other models. According to this research, it makes sense to use the Porter's Diamond Model and the Collective Efficiency approach to assess the company's performance. The researcher can then do a comprehensive analysis of all data (Neven & Droge n.d.).

            Di Wu (2006) presented another example of the Porter's Diamond Model being applied to explain home and host locations strategies in international business. In his research paper, the analyst tries to analyze Chinese automotive industry's competitive competence within the Porter's Diamond framework. The model was chosen by the researcher because of the questions he had to analyze: the evaluation of the Chinese automobile industry's competitiveness and the government's impact on their performance. The Porter's Diamond Model, as we know, includes both the main conditions that determine the performance of industries. This research considers both the general characteristics of the auto industry and the descriptions of specific company cases such as Toyota Motor and Ford. These cases can be easily applied to Porter's Diamond, according to the researcher. He uses the Toyota Motor example to show that the home environment is an important factor in developing a competitive industry. Toyota Motors' first steps were made possible by sufficient government investment and a large number of highly qualified employees.

            Wu (2006) assumes that Porter's Diamond Model, which emphasizes the importance of inner demand levels, is consistent with the second example. He also points out the relative nature of the argument, as China's home market is undoubtedly its largest market. He also acknowledges that the Porter's Diamond Model has neglected to consider the impact of FDI on company performance. Both Ford and Toyota Motors' cases showed that FDI was an important factor in understanding the competitive capabilities of the companies studied. Wu (2006) also found that globalization, whose impact is evidently under-estimated by the Porter's Diamond concept, was more important than the model suggests. This research shows that the Porter's Diamond Model can be applied to the analysis of a specific firm case, rather than providing a general estimate of national competitiveness, as is often suggested (Smit 2010,).

            Sardi & Fetscherin (2009) describe a unique case in which the Porter's Diamond Model was applied. They did a thorough analysis of the automobile industries of South Korea, India, China. Contrary to what was previously stated, this research appears to be the best case for using the Porter's Diamond Model because it is conducted in several countries. This is especially beneficial for estimating competitive competence. In addition to the research described above, Sardi (2009) and Fetscherin (2009, respectively) also point out the rationality of Porter's Diamond Model by emphasizing the home environment as the main determinant of a company's success. They support Michael Porter's side, putting a particular emphasis on labor resources as a key factor in the development and maintenance of competitive competence. Research shows that China's high-productive workforce puts it ahead of South Korea and India. Its innovative efforts are also a significant contributor to the country's competitive image, which fully aligns with Porter's main ideas. The researchers arrive at a surprising conclusion after a careful analysis of all the data.

            Sardi (2009) and Fetscherin ((2009) believe they have enough evidence to prove the model's inefficiency. They suggest that a similar model be introduced, but it would be modified slightly to gain the advantages. They propose to create the Double Diamond Model, which would be more sensitive to the influence of external factors and government factor. They believe that it would be very beneficial if the advanced Diamond Model included such factors as management strategy and policy examination. Their research has shown that management performance is a key factor in the company's ability to compete. This criterion is not fully considered in Porter's Diamond Model. They consider it reasonable to modify the initial structure of the model (Sardy & Fetscherin, 2009).

            The Porter's Diamond Model, based on the above information, can be used to provide an acceptable explanation of the home-host location strategies for international business under a variety of conditions. It will be more effective if it is applied to cases that are within the context of advanced countries. Researchers who want to use this model for assessing performance of developing countries should choose industries that are similar around the globe (Peng 2014). Second, even though this model is sometimes criticized as being too broad, statistics show that Porter's Diamond Model can be used to analyze industrial clusters, specific firms, and companies. The question has shown that the model works best when supported by other theoretical concepts, such as the Flexible Specialization Theory and the Collective Efficiency Model. If the Porter's Diamonds concept doesn't pay enough attention to external factors and corporate management, the application of supportive tools can make up for it. The practice shows that a researcher can use the Porter's Diamond Model's concept in both its entirety and part. This means that the study of a specific phenomenon may require the use of multiple Porter's postulates as well as the extension of existing frameworks to the benefit of the researcher. Modern business analytics demands the development of new techniques and approaches capable of explaining current business phenomena, taking into account their particularities and newly discovered specificity (Frynas & Mellahi 2011,).
