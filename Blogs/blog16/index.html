            <h4><b>Summary</b></h4>
            The report "Lacking communication in the process of change" describes the problems that can arise when changes are not communicated to employees. Employees must understand that they have priority within the company and that any changes made to the organization will not negatively affect them.
            <br>
            <br>
            This report outlines the communication problems that can arise from the changes, and offers tips on how to fix them. The organization's entire function will fail if there is insufficient communication. All changes in an organization should be communicated in advance to employees and their opinions taken into consideration.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>

            Communication is a human endeavor. The process of exchanging ideas and information, as well as the transmission or exchange of them, constitutes communication. There are many types of communication: oral, written, and visual.
            <br>
            <br>
            Only the effectiveness of communication matters. This includes the ability to provide feedback and respond appropriately to stimuli. A lack of communication can also lead to nullified results. Communication has many uses. They are used for information, memory, persuasion and interpretation.
            <br>
            <br>
            "Communication" is a term that behavioral theorists, management researchers, and the general population use most often. "We will use this page to present a definition of communication that has changed over time." Jay, 2009. Para.
            <br>
            <br>
            Most organizations consider managing communication a difficult task. When an organization is facing changes and the information is not communicated to employees, this problem can arise. This problem can be solved by creating a communication strategy within your organization.
            <br>
            <br>
            Every organization needs to adapt. Organizations are often forced to change their organization strategy due to technological changes. All organizational changes must be communicated with employees. It could lead to problems and distract the entire process. If the changes are not communicated correctly, employees might resist them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Coetsee (1999), states that "management's ability in order to reap maximum benefits from changes depends in part upon how they create and sustain a climate that minimizes resistance behavior and encourages acceptance (p. 205)" (Evans 2004).
            <br>
            <br>
            Change agents are responsible for creating organizational changes. The change agents are the ones responsible for making relevant changes in the organization. "A change agent is a person who leads a business-wide change project by planning, organizing, building support for the business, and carefully selecting volunteers to join a change team." (Change agent 2009).
            <br>

            Communication is more important in the pharmaceutical industry because it deals with the production of drugs. Any increase or decrease of the quality or quantity of the drug may have an adverse effect on the lives of people.
            <br>
            <br>
            Communication among employees involved in the production process can help to solve this problem. Communication errors can lead to serious and major problems. This is why it is important to communicate with employees about any changes within the company.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Communication is crucial in change processes</b></h4>

            An organization's ability to change is vital in many ways. It is essential for the organization's success. It should be designed so that employees feel comfortable with it and encourage them to think outside the box.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important to understand the pros and cons of each system in order to avoid confusion and perplexing. There are many types of organizational changes. Unclarified organizational plans can threaten the process of change.
            <br>
            <br>
            The first assumption is that there are four types of organizational change:
            <br>
            <br>
            - Process Change
            <br>
            - System Change
            <br>
            - Structural changes
            <br>
            - Organizational change. (Seel, 2008, Introduction, para.2).
            <br>
            <br>
            Communication can have a negative impact on the various changes. Change is an ongoing process. There is no point at which change can stop. People find it difficult to understand the changes that are occurring.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important to communicate the organizational norms and changes in a clear manner. Employees may find it difficult to adapt to the new culture.
            <br>
            <br>
            "Culture changes are difficult and time-consuming, because "culture" is rooted within the collective history of an organization" (Organizational Change, 2005, para.
            <br>
            <br>
            The purpose of the change process is to improve the organization and increase its performance. The organization suffers from a lack of communication. An organization's main goal is to successfully implement the process. However, if communication is not good, it can have a severe effect.
            <br>
            <br>
            Inflexibility in work conditions can be caused by a lack of communication. This could also cause hatred of the job. It is important to treat the change in a professional manner and communicate it in a clear and thoughtful way. Communication problems can be exacerbated by the pain of work. These may also be related to other types of unease, which could lead to the chaos in the current situation.
            <br>
            <br>
            Organizations have had to change due to the rapid advancements in technology, management, and production. The organization must be able to adapt to the changing world.
            <br>
            <br>
            The management is responsible for this responsibility. Management experience is the primary reason communication is so difficult in the workplace. (Lacking communication sends employees out of the door 2006.
            <br>
            <br>
            Although changes are generally good for any organization, it can cause major problems if they're not communicated to employees. The typewriter was still used in the early days to do all the paper work. However, computers now play a major role in various activities across different departments.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the beginning, employees felt scared that computers might be introduced to the company and could lose their jobs. However, employees began to realize the benefits of computers and started to accept the change. This was only possible through effective communication.
