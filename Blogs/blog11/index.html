            <h5><b>Statement on Thesis</b></h5>
            You can call or text your friends to talk about anything, ask them about something, or invite them to a cup or tea. The choice is up to you, depending on your financial situation, emotional aspect, or both.

            The information age is here, with the advent of mobile phones and the Internet. Mobile phones are by far the most popular gadget. You can call or text your friends to talk about anything, ask for advice, or invite them to a cup of tea. The choice is up to you, the financial situation, and how appropriate it is.
            <br>
            <br>
            Texting is universally acceptable and more convenient than calling. However, it should be noted that you cannot call someone at any given time. Each person takes some time to do their job, live a private life, or rest. To make a call one must consider the unique characteristics of the person calling.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you find out that your friend is working, it's likely you will change your mind. It makes sense to send a message instead of calling your friend. Some situations might be appropriate for this approach.
            <br>
            <br>
            Texting, for example, is the best way to communicate information such as "I will be at 6", or "Meet us at the theater entrance". This allows you to quickly and easily resolve the problem without distracting your friends.
            <br>
            <br>
            You might also decide to call your friend at night, but suspect that they are sleeping. How do you know if it is true? Send a message. A SMS melody will not wake your friend. It is possible to get an answer.
            <br>
            <br>
            Texting is less emotional than talking in conversation. Writing is not able to convey emotions, which is crucial for successful communication. Different emotional colorings can make the same text appear very different.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is best to avoid calling someone when you feel that the conversation involves some sensitive or controversial points. You cannot predict the mood of your friend and other events may have preceded your message.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can also get instant feedback from your friend by calling and hearing their reaction to your words. This gives you the chance to make changes immediately. It is always better to call than to send a text message at times.
            <br>
            <br>
            You should not let your emotions overpower you. The voice conversation does not have a "take it back" button, unlike Outlook and Gmail which allow you to cancel a letter already sent.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can save money by sending a message. The Internet is the best and most popular way to share information via e-mail. Texting can be used in the same manner on a mobile network. Lenhart says that text messaging is an important component of daily friend interactions (7).
            <br>

            Short Message Service can be a powerful tool that offers a wide range of services. You can also save up to 90% compared to calling. You can save up to 90% compared to calling.

            <br>
            Saving time can also be a very profitable thing. Calling is, however, more costly. You cannot also answer the phone for any reason. However, you will likely read the message because of elementary curiosity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Both texting and calling friends or talking to them via phone are common and easy nowadays. It is important to choose the appropriate communication method according to the individual features of the person being contacted. Talking to friends is more human because it involves voice communication, emotions, and immediate feedback.
