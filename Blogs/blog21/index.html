            <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>

            Modern business has seen a dramatic shift in the way it operates (Teece 2010, 2010). Customers today have more options because they can access alternatives to any product (Teece 2010,). Modern product retailing is fiercely competitive. The supermarket industry is one of its most important areas. Supermarket industry players must use successful business strategies to achieve success. Low pricing is a popular strategy to attract customers and promote sustainability within this industry. Based on literature review, it is possible to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of this business strategy and make recommendations for its future implementation in supermarkets.

            <h4><b>A popular business strategy is to offer low pricing every day</b></h4>
            
            The pricing strategies of other competitors can have a significant impact on the prices in the food retailing industry. The pricing strategies of competitors can have a significant impact on the pricing decisions made by stores. The company then decides which strategy it will use to set prices and adjust its overall strategy (Dorfman, 2014). Procter & Gamble introduced daily low pricing in the 1990s to lessen the negative effects of retailers' forward buying and diverting (Shimp 2010, p. 469). This practice implies that a manufacturer charges the same price every day for a brand to maintain stable prices for retailers (Shimp 2010 p. 469). This strategy was adopted by many retailers later on. It is based on keeping prices low and not relying on price cuts in the short-term (Kurtz & Boone 2009). Numerous supermarket chains have successfully used this strategy. This business strategy can be effectively implemented by Wal-Mart.

            <h4><b>Literature Review</b></h4>
            
            Many academics have studied the low pricing strategy since it became one of the most common business practices in the supermarket sector. They also present relevant information in various literature resources. This strategy can be examined by examining the views of other researchers by studying peer-reviewed books and articles.
            <br>
            <br>
            Many sources have discussed the positive effects of everyday low prices on the overall profitability and viability of supermarket retail businesses. Volpe (2011) claims that daily low pricing is one of the best strategies to allow supermarkets to compete with hypermarkets. This pricing strategy seems to be effective in "mitigating hypermarkets’ negative effects", Volpe 2011, p. 500. The same strategy is not as successful for manufacturers. Kazmi (2007) describes the experiences of Procter & Gamble with everyday low pricing strategies and identifies such unhappy retailers as the company's main drawback.

            <br>
            Many sources provide information on the various factors that affect the effectiveness of low-priced everyday strategies. Schroth and Socorro Souza da Mota (2014) examine the different pricing strategies that attracted consumers. According to the authors, the decision about which strategy should be used depends on how clients are served (Schroth &Socorro Souza da Mota 2014 p. 203). According to the authors, the evidence supports the claim that customers who make less frequent purchases and have smaller purchases is more likely to appreciate a low-priced everyday strategy. High-low pricing strategies attract customers who are interested in shopping frequently with small purchases. "Large-basket customers" prefer everyday low prices because they care about the overall price of all products (Schroth &Socorro Souza da Mota 2014 p. 203). Ellickson & Misra (2008) agree with this assertion and believe that everyday low pricing is more appropriate for retailers who operate in areas with low-income populations and less access to public transport. The researchers also stress the importance of gathering "postgame outcome data" in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the strategy in a particular store (Ellickson & Misra 2008 p. 825).
            <br>
            <br>
            Although many studies back the effectiveness of low pricing, there are some articles and books that highlight the negative aspects of this practice and emphasize the benefits of high-low pricing. Hamister and Suresh (2008) carried out a large quantitative survey that showed that constant pricing could reduce the retailer's profitability "under the circumstances of serial correlation". (p. 453) According to Hamister and Suresh 2007, such a reduction could be significant for supermarkets with low profit margins. Solomon et al. Solomon et al. (2009) examine the benefits of a high-low pricing strategy that can compete with everyday low prices. According to the authors, supermarkets that use a high-low pricing strategy are able to promote quality food and ethical shopping (Solomon and al. 2009). Volpe and Li (2012) support the idea that high-low pricing can bring many benefits, if sales and promotions were used with care.

            <h4><b>Evaluation of the Strategy</b></h4>
            
            An analysis of relevant literature revealed that low prices are a good practice for supermarkets. It is proven to be effective in the hypermarkets market and can increase supermarkets' compatibility. Low pricing is a high-effective strategy that has been proven to work in everyday situations. This can be seen by the success of hypermarket chains like Wal-Mart, IKEA, and supermarket chains like Tesco and Aldi. This practice should only be used after careful consideration of the factors that influence its effectiveness. It is important to examine the results of this strategy in order to determine its strengths and weaknesses.
            <br>
            <br>
            <h4><b>Recommendations</b></h4>
            
            Implementing a low-priced everyday strategy is dependent on your prior research on the specific market that you are trying to enter. The most important advice to this sector is to research the trends in the market and any possible impact they have on pricing decisions by competitors. Analyzing potential customers is also a good idea, since the effectiveness of low-priced everyday strategies is greatly affected by their clientele. To adjust the strategy to meet the needs of clients, it is important to analyze the income, shopping habits, age and other factors.
            <br>
            <br>
            A second recommendation for supermarkets to use everyday low pricing strategies is that they must determine the primary goals of the business. If the company is looking to reduce inventory costs or minimize stock shortage risks, switching to this strategy could be a great option. You may also need to improve the coordination of supply chain chains. Any retailer who is considering changing to everyday low prices should carefully consider the factors.

            An analysis of relevant literature on everyday low prices reveals its effectiveness in the supermarkets industry. It also demonstrates the details that retailers should carefully study before implementing it.
