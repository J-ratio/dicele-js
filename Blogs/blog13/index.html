            One of the most important features that can be used as a description of the United States' population is its socio-cultural diversity. This diversity is reflected in all spheres of society. Nursing and nursing education are dependent on being able to adapt to this diversity. Nursing practitioners must be able to adapt to the diversity of society and offer services with respect and dignity for representatives from different social groups.
            <br>
            <br>
            This is where the emphasis on cultural competence of nurses becomes important. It can be continuously improved due to the increasing demand for culturally competent and adequate nursing care.
            <br>
            <br>
            The solution to the problem with culturally incompetent nurses services is to improve nursing education and incorporate more patient-oriented training in current courses at colleges and universities. The implementation plan outlines the steps necessary for implementing the solution.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>Methods to get the support you need to implement your plan</b></h5>
            
            It is imperative to implement the plan that focuses on improving nursing education in relation with cultural competency. This should be supported by extensive data about the instances in which cultural competence was lacking.
            <br>
            <br>    
            It is important to keep track of the cases and analyze the problems. Then, the report should be sent to the leadership and other staff to get the support needed. If the problem is not resolved at the state level, it should be noted in the report.
            <br>

            <h5><b>Description of the Problem Of Cultural Competency In Nursing Practice</b></h5>
            
            Cultural competency is an issue in nursing practice. This is because nurses today are faced with the challenge of providing high-quality care to a diverse population. The lack of cultural competence often means that nurses are unable to provide adequate care and services. Many clients remain dissatisfied by the nursing care they receive, as their traditions and values can be violated (Kutob and colleagues, 2013).
            <br>
            <br>
            This issue is being discussed at both the state and federal levels. The cultural competency courses are also integrated into the colleges and universities of the country. However, the problem remains because integration of patient-centered care principles into practice requires nurses to have a high level of qualification.
            <br>
            <br>
            Weaknesses in the nursing curriculum are the root cause of this problem. Because nurses are trained to offer high-quality nursing services to diverse populations and to focus on their clients' values and differences, the current approach to cultural competency development in nursing education is satisfactory. The problem has been reported and improvements are needed to rectify it.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>The Solution Proposed: An Explanation</b></h5>
            
            It is important to improve the nursing education and cultural competence of nurses in order to solve the problem. Cultural competency refers to the ability to provide patient-oriented nursing services that are based on clients' beliefs, values and traditions. Many nurses lack the knowledge and skills necessary to be culturally competent, despite the fact that this should be the norm (Kutob and al., 2013).
            <br>
            <br>
            It is therefore important to enhance the courses in cultural competency and to include them in nursing education, while still ensuring that the patient-oriented training is maintained.
            <br>
            <br>
            It is important to integrate the better theoretical courses and the practical activities that are related to cultural competency into nursing curricula. This is because nurses practitioners need to understand that cultural competency is complex and requires continuous practice with reference towards the principles of transcultural nurse.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>Justification for selecting the Solution</b></h5>
            
            There are many arguments that support the need to improve nursing education in relation cultural competence. Cultural competency is essential in nursing practice as it promotes client safety through nurses' culturally competent actions. Patients should expect to not only receive high-quality care but also to be treated with respect and dignity.
            <br>
            <br>
            Clients will feel less secure if nurses aren't aware of their values or violate cultural norms and differences. Patients can feel dissatisfied and ineffective if there are language barriers or cultural sensitivity (Delgado and al., 2013). This is why more attention should be given to the development and application of cultural competence by nursing professionals.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>There are evidences that support the necessity of proposed changes</b></h5>
            
            Madeleine Leininger actively focuses on the needs and diversity of the population when it comes to nursing practice. She also refers to her idea for transcultural nursing to ensure patients' safety & satisfaction (Boyle & Hinrichs 2013, 2013). Leininger creates the transcultural nursing concept as the basis for Theory of Culture Care: Diversity and Universality. Ray, 2013. p. 142).
            <br>
            <br>
            Leininger states that a nurse-patient relationship can yield positive results if the nurse is able to respect the client's culture, values, and provide appropriate patient-oriented care. A nurse must be able to anticipate the needs of patients and can respond accordingly. Nursing education should follow the principles of transcultural nursing.
            <br>
            <br>
            Culturally compatible care relies on the important cultural fundament that should include nurses' knowledge about the values, religion, norms and languages of patients in order to promote patient-centred care.
            <br>
            <br>
            Culturally competent nursing care must be the result of a proper nursing education. Nurses need to have the theoretical knowledge and the practical skills to work with diverse populations (Ray, 2013). Understanding the needs of patients is the key to high-quality nursing care. This is why the concept of cultural competence is so important.
            <br>

            <br>
            <h5><b>Implementation Logistics</b></h5>
            
            Improvement of nursing education in cultural competency should be done at all levels: district, state and federal. The majority of universities and colleges offer courses in cultural competency. However, additional courses should be offered in higher schools. These courses will include lectures and seminars lasting 30-40 hours and clinical immersions that last several weeks.
            <br>
            <br>
            The courses should have been developed and designed in the academic year 2014-2015. In 2015-2016, the organization of additional courses at local colleges and universities should take place. High-quality data resources should be made available to nursing students in order to enhance their theoretical knowledge.
            <br>
            <br>
            The next steps in the implementation process begin at this point:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. The course programs in cultural competency are designed to bring together the practical and theoretical knowledge. These course programs are developed by the US Department of Education state representatives. Timescale: The academic year 2014-2015.
            <br>
            2. Approval of the program and any revisions. Timescale: The academic year 2014-2015.
            <br>
            3. Preparation of data sources in order to provide students with the required materials. This is the responsibility of the US Department of Education state representatives.
            <br>
            4. Implementation of the immersion programs and theoretical courses in the state, district, local colleges and universities, as the basic or further courses.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <h5><b>Resources required for the implementation of the Plan</b></h5>
            
            1. Staff: This involves educators and representatives from the US Department of Education to create the new courses.
            <br>
            2. Educational Materials: To implement cultural competency courses, you will need new handouts or textbooks that provide more cultural information.
            <br>
            3. Assessment Tools: Nurses need to be able to understand their progress through pre- and post-tests.
            <br>
            4. To cover the cost of designing and developing courses, funds should be allocated to the implementation plan.
            <br>
            5. To ensure that the improvements are implemented into nursing curricula, supervisors should be chosen from the US Department of Education
